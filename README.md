# NEW UBUNTU EXPERIENCE

## Purpose

I lost all my files due to the system crash when I installed some games with playonlinux. But for my perspective, the most thing is that i have no realization of the importance of backing up my files or my progress so that I spent much time on doing the base things. I decide to create a project to log something so that I can remember it as soon as possible later.

## Content

The project contains:

+ software that i'm using

and i will supplement it for a long time.

## Annotation

Something need to be added is that this seems to be the third times my system crashed. The main reason could be that I installed two ubuntu kylin system ,I installed the playonlinux or the hard disk problem.

Another thing I get from the system crash is Post your files that was completed before shutting down your system.
